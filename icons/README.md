# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following PNG icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## How to Generate Icons

### Option 1: Use the HTML Generator
1. Open `generate-icons.html` in a web browser
2. Click the download buttons to save each icon size
3. Place the downloaded files in this directory

### Option 2: Create Custom Icons
You can create your own icons using any image editor. The icons should:
- Have a transparent or colored background
- Be clearly visible at small sizes (16x16)
- Represent the YouTube transcript functionality
- Use colors that match the extension theme (red/white)

### Option 3: Use Online Icon Generators
1. Use online favicon generators with the SVG file
2. Generate PNG files in the required sizes
3. Download and place them in this directory

## Temporary Workaround
If you don't have icon files yet, you can:
1. Create simple colored square PNG files as placeholders
2. Update them later with proper designs
3. The extension will still work without icons (Chrome will use defaults)

## Design Guidelines
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use high contrast colors
- Consider the YouTube branding (red color scheme)
- Include visual elements suggesting transcripts/text
- Ensure readability in both light and dark themes
